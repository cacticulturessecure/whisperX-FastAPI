Write me a poem about fastly and how I hate working there. Love the tech but management directly above me sucks, but management above them is good. Lol

I'm sure you've heard of Fastly,
Where the tech is so fly,
But the management above me,
Man, they make me want to cry.

They're so out of touch,
With the work that we do,
It's like they're from another planet,
And I'm just trying to get through.

But the management above them,
They're a whole different breed,
They actually know what's up,
And they're willing to lead.

So I guess it's a mixed bag,
Working at Fastly, you see,
The tech is top-notch,
But the management, well, it's not for me.
